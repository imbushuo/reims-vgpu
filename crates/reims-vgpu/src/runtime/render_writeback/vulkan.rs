//! The Vulkan rail's half of the writeback: a resident's pixels into the
//! guest's own pages, with no CPU round trip.
//!
//! [`super`] owns what every rail owes the guest — the settle sites, and the
//! wait that has to happen before any host reader touches pages a GPU may still
//! be writing. That half is neutral: it asks
//! [`crate::backend::Backend::guest_writes_outstanding`] and reads the answer.
//!
//! This half is the copy itself, and it is Vulkan's alone because a resident is:
//! every entry point here takes a
//! [`crate::backend::vulkan::engine::TargetIdentity`], and a rail that holds no
//! residents has nothing to name. The three destinations are the three
//! namespaces the guest renders into — a mapper-ref-texture mapping, a guest-backed
//! surface, and a raw GVA plane — and each is reached only from that rail's own
//! draw, blit or compute path.
//!
//! Split out rather than left as eighteen `cfg`-ed items below the neutral
//! settle. The gate is the module's, once.

/// Land a GVA render Store's frame in the guest's pages, GPU-direct where the

///
/// # The ladder, and why it is here rather than at one call site
///
/// The GPU-direct arm below needs a guest-RAM reference over the destination
/// pages, which is `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` or nothing. On a host without
/// that extension — and on every discrete GPU, where `linear_target_import`
/// refuses `UnsupportedTopology` — it declines every Store of every GVA target
/// with `gvawb_guest_ref_refused via=guest_ram_map_no_backend_import`.
///
/// That decline used to be a **lost frame** for one of the two callers. The
/// eager site in `draw::vulkan` carries its own copying rail (`gva_store_sync`:
/// read the resident back, then `write_gva_rgba8_within`), so it never sees
/// one; the deferred site — [`crate::runtime::writeback_debt::pay_for_texture`],
/// which pays a resource's debt at the moment the guest samples it — had
/// nothing behind the decline and reported `gvadebt_pay_lost`. A driven
/// macos-13 boot under `REIMS_VGPU_GUEST_IMPORT=off` read **27
/// `gvadebt_paid_named` and 27 `gvadebt_pay_lost`**: every deferred payment on
/// that host class lost its frame, and because the failure also released the
/// debt, the sampled rail then read guest pages the frame had never reached.
/// Thirteen of the twenty-seven were one texture of one task re-rendered over
/// and over, which on screen is a window whose content stays blank while its
/// chrome draws.
///
/// So the copying arm lives here, in the function that owns "land this GVA
/// Store", and both callers get it. A decline of the direct arm is a *cost* —
/// a blocking readback plus a host pass over the frame — and never a loss.
///
/// # What the licence is
///
/// A mapping carries its own page list and a page-table vouch licenses it; a
/// GVA carries neither, so the licence is the exact page list supplied in
/// `pages`, which **neither** arm may widen. The eager fallback captures it
/// before draw submission; deferred payment gets it from the live resource's
/// transfer backing. `pages == None` is therefore still `Unlicensed` on both
/// arms: there is no authorisation to write anywhere, and a copy is not a
/// second opinion about that.
/// # What `skip` is
///
/// Bytes from `c0.target_gva` this store may not write, because the guest's own
/// memory holds something newer there. Every eager caller passes `&[]`: a Store
/// landing at the moment it is issued has nothing to make room for. The
/// deferred caller can have something, and the empty slice is the wrong answer
/// for it — see `writeback_debt::pay_gva`.
///
/// A non-empty `skip` forces the copying rail. The GPU-direct arm copies the
/// resident into the plane as one image region and has no way to exclude pages
/// from it, so a caller that must exclude some pays the readback. That is the
/// right price: the alternative is losing one of the two writers, and it is
/// paid only when the hypervisor has actually reported a guest write into a
/// plane this device still owes a frame for.
