//! Whether a host-side copy of a mapper-ref-texture surface's pixels is still
//! that surface's content.
//!
//! # The question
//!
//! A mapper-ref-texture surface's pixels are plain guest RAM. The guest CPU
//! stores into them with no device operation at all, so nothing in this
//! device's own command stream marks the moment a host-side copy — a render
//! resident, the [`crate::runtime::surface_cache`] frame, an attachment LOAD
//! seed — stopped being the surface. The hypervisor's dirty bitmap is the only
//! witness, and [`crate::runtime::mapper::mapping_guest_write_verdict`] is how
//! this device reads it.
//!
//! Every consumer of a host-side copy has to ask this before serving one, and
//! there is exactly one right answer per `(mapping, window)` — so it is asked
//! here, once, and each rail names the outcome under its own census keys.
//!
//! # Why it is two stages and not one
//!
//! The tracking token covers the mapping's whole page list, and its generation
//! moves for a write to any page in it. A backing allocation is bigger than the
//! plane a bind samples: `mapper_ref_texture_sample_window` reports a `base_off`
//! precisely because the pixels do not start at offset 0, and an allocation can
//! carry a second plane and end padding past `span_end`. Refusing on the coarse
//! answer alone discarded whole 1920x1080 compositor scanouts whose pixels the
//! GPU had rendered and nothing had touched — measured live as a black desktop
//! at 17 Hz, against 120 Hz and a painted one on the same boot script with the
//! narrowing in place.
//!
//! So the coarse stage decides whether the page-list walk is worth paying for,
//! and the walk decides the answer. The walk is paid on the minority of asks
//! the coarse stage flags.
//!
//! # Which answers are evidence
//!
//! Only [`crate::runtime::mapper::GuestWriteVerdict::Wrote`] is evidence of a
//! guest write. `NoStamp` says "nobody asked the host to watch these pages",
//! which is a statement about this device's arming and not about the guest; on
//! the boot that first measured the ladder it was 14 092 of 14 396 cache binds,
//! so refusing on it would turn every host-side copy off on the strength of a
//! rail that was never armed.
//!
//! The narrowing fails closed in the other direction. Everything the host
//! cannot answer exactly — no token, no enumerable page list, no resolvable
//! sample window, or written GPAs this mapping does not own — is
//! [`SurfaceCurrency::WroteUnknown`], which does not serve. Serving a stale copy
//! is a wrong frame that is then *held*, because the pass composites onto the
//! seed and its Store publishes the composite back over the guest's pages;
//! re-reading the guest's pages costs a copy.
