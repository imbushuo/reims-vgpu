//! Colour render targets this rail keeps alive across draws.
//!
//! # What it removes, and why the target was ephemeral to begin with
//!
//! Every colour attachment used to be a fresh `MTLTexture` per draw: allocate,
//! upload the whole attachment's prior content into it with `replace_region`,
//! render, `getBytes` the whole attachment back out, drop the texture. On a
//! driven macos-13 boot the upload alone was `metal_rt_seed_us` = 1 670 us a
//! draw, 31 % of this rail's `engine_us` and the largest single item in it;
//! the readback was another 19 % and the allocation 1 %.
//!
//! The attachment was ephemeral because nothing in this rail retained a
//! host-side render target at all — not because the guest's stream asks for
//! one. A compositing layer is drawn into over and over, and every draw of it
//! was paying to move 8 MB in and 8 MB out.
//!
//! # The safety argument is borrowed, not new
//!
//! A retained target may only be *loaded from* when its pixels are this pass's
//! prior content, and getting that wrong is a silent wrong frame: the pass
//! composites onto the stale pixels and its Store publishes the composite back
//! over the guest's own pages, so the next frame loads what this one stored.
//!
//! This module does not make a new claim about content. It makes exactly one:
//!
//! > When [`crate::runtime::surface_cache`] would have served bytes `B` as this
//! > attachment's LOAD seed, and the retained texture is known to hold `B`, do
//! > not copy `B` into it again.
//!
//! "Would have served" is [`crate::runtime::draw`]'s door, already gated on
//! [`crate::runtime::surface_currency::CurrencyStandard::WatchedAndUnwritten`].
//! "Is known to hold `B`" is [`Resident::content_gen`]: the surface cache's own
//! `host_gen` at the moment this rail's Store published the texture's pixels
//! into it. Every writer of `host_surfaces` takes a fresh
//! `DeviceState::next_sampled_content_generation` in the same breath as it
//! changes the bytes, and `surface_cache::forget` removes the entry outright —
//! so a generation that still matches is a statement that nothing has replaced
//! the frame this texture was published as.
//!
//! The consequence worth stating: this rail can never be *more* wrong than the
//! seed door it rides on. If that door is correct, so is this; if it is not,
//! this changes only how expensive the wrong answer was to produce.
//!
//! # Eviction is lawful here
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` forbids silently evicting resource state that represents guest
//! work. A resident here represents none: its pixels are also in the guest's
//! own pages and in the surface cache, which is *why* the currency test can be
//! asked at all. Dropping one costs the next draw an upload and loses nothing,
//! so the bound below is a cache bound in the sense that is allowed. Every
//! eviction is still counted, because a rail that spends its whole budget
//! thrashing is indistinguishable from one that is off.
