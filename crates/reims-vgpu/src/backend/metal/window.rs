//! The Metal rail's half of the host-owned presentation window
//! ([[host-window]]): a `CAMetalLayer` on the window's own `NSView`, and the
//! blit that puts a published guest frame into its next drawable.
//!
//! The mirror of `backend::vulkan::engine::window_present`, and the two are
//! reached through the same six [`crate::backend::Backend`] methods, so the
//! window itself never learns which one it is talking to. That is the whole
//! point of running this rail: the same guest stream, the same window, the same
//! input, with only the executor changed — which is what makes a wrong frame
//! attributable to `metal2vulkan` rather than to this device.
//!
//! # What this rail presents from
//!
//! CPU bytes, always. The Metal rail retains no texture past the encode that
//! produced it — every colour target in [`super::render`] is created,
//! CPU-seeded, read back and dropped inside one `render_core_mrt` — so there is
//! no resident for a present to name, and [`crate::backend::window::WindowResident`]
//! carries no Metal variant. That is the same path the QEMU display took: the
//! frame already crossed host memory before this window existed, and nothing
//! here adds a copy that the Cocoa path did not also pay.
//!
//! # Why a render pass and not a blit encoder
//!
//! The guest frame has to be aspect-fitted into the drawable, and a
//! `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` copies without scaling. Vulkan's presenter uses
//! `vkCmdBlitImage`, which does scale; the Metal equivalent is a one-triangle
//! render pass with the viewport set to the fitted rectangle and the clear
//! colour showing through the letterbox bars. It also puts the fit in this
//! file, where [`crate::backend::window::viewport::aspect_fit`] is the same
//! function the pointer path maps through — presentation and input move as one
//! unit, or a click lands where the pixel is not.
