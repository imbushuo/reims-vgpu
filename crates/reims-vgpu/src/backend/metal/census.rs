//! The census lines only the Metal rail can answer.

//! This rail's compiled-object cache, retained colour targets, and completed
//! input-buffer inventory. The Vulkan rail asks the first of those of entirely
//! different tables and has no counterpart for the second, which is why both
//! are reached through [`crate::backend::Backend::emit_census`] rather than
//! through one `cfg`-selected function — a build carrying both rails has to
//! print the lines belonging to the device it is actually running.
//!
//! They live here and not beside the drain's neutral census for the same
//! reason: the only things they read are this rail's own tables, and a
//! reporting module in the neutral runtime forced those tables to be
//! re-exported out of the rail so a stranger could count them.

/// This rail's compiled-object cache levels, as **levels** rather than
/// per-window deltas — the same question and cadence as its Vulkan
/// counterpart, over different tables. This arm builds `MTLFunction` / `MTLRenderPipelineState` /
/// `MTLComputePipelineState` / `MTLSamplerState` / `MTLDepthStencilState` and
/// compute reflections, and holds them in `backend::metal::cache`.
///
/// No `m2v` field: AIR reaches Metal directly on this arm, so
/// `runtime::m2v_cache` is never populated and a zero there would read as an
/// empty cache rather than an absent rail.
