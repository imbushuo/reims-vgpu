//! The Vulkan rail's pixel table, as this device's engine and rails ask for it.
//!
//! **The Metal→Vulkan table itself is [`reims_vgpu_vulkan::pixel`].** It is a
//! function of its inputs with no state, no handle and no host capability, so
//! it belongs to the rail crate and not to the device model that calls it. What
//! is left here is the part that names things the rail crate must not: the
//! engine's own [`StorageImageFormat`] vocabulary, the clear-value carrier a
//! colour attachment is created with, and the always-on
//! [`srgb_census`](crate::runtime::census::srgb_census) that records a dropped
//! transfer function.
//!
//! # Who records the loss changed, deliberately
//!
//! The table used to note the sRGB downgrade from inside the translation. The
//! rail crate cannot see `runtime`, and it should not: *which* rail took a
//! downgrade is a fact about the caller, not about the format. So the doors
//! that can lose the qualifier now say so in their answer —
//! [`reims_vgpu_vulkan::pixel::Sampled::srgb_lost`] — and the census note is
//! made here, at the site that knows which rail it is. The set of sites and the
//! slug they record are unchanged.
//!
//! # The refusal vocabulary is mapped, not shared
//!
//! The rail crate declines with its own module-local
//! [`reims_vgpu_vulkan::pixel::Refusal`], because a crate that named this
//! device's [`TranslateReason`] would be a rail that depends on the device
//! model. [`reason`](super::reason) is still the one vocabulary this device
//! declines in, and the mapping below is where the two meet.
