//! The host driver's answer to the guest's `heapTextureSizeAndAlign` contract.
//!
//! # Why this is neither a `Backend` method nor part of `backend::metal`
//!
//! The guest is asking what Apple's driver requires to place one texture in a
//! heap. That is a term of the guest ABI, and the answer has to be the same on
//! every rail this host can run: the arm64 macOS pathway executes one guest
//! stream through Metal and through MoltenVK without a rebuild, and a heap
//! layout that differed between them would be this device answering a guest
//! contract with a host implementation detail.
//!
//! So the running rail does not enter into it, and neither does the *compiled*
//! one. The gate below is `target_os = "macos"` alone — the gate this code has
//! always carried — because the question is whether a driver exists to be
//! asked, not which rail this build ships. Moving it under `backend::metal`,
//! which is gated on `feature = "backend-metal"`, would silently make the
//! macOS Vulkan pathway start refusing a query it answers today.
//!
//! Everything above this — the request decode, the descriptor, the reply
//! encoding, the refusal vocabulary — is wire and stays in
//! [`crate::runtime::heap_query`]. Only the driver call is here.
