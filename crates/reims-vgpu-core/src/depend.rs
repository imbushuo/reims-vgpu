//! The hazard half of the dependency compiler: which earlier transactions a
//! newly admitted one must wait for, and why.
//!
//! # What this is and is not
//!
//! This compiles **hazard** edges — the ones that exist because two accesses
//! touch the same memory and at least one of them writes. It does not compile
//! explicit synchronisation. Events and fences can name a point that has not
//! been signalled yet, so they are unresolved prerequisites with their own
//! wait-for graph and their own cycle diagnostic; folding them in here would
//! destroy the one property that makes this graph trivially acyclic.
//!
//! That property is the reason transactions are admitted in ingress order and
//! never re-derived: **every edge this compiler creates points from a newer
//! ingress ordinal to an older one**, so ingress order is a topological order
//! for hazards. It is asserted rather than assumed, on every admission.
//!
//! # Imprecision costs a scan, and the census charges it
//!
//! Accesses are indexed by the thing they name — a backing, a heap — so
//! admitting one compares against the accesses that could possibly conflict
//! rather than against all of them. [`AccessKey::DomainOnly`] is the exception
//! by construction: an access whose participation is unknown could touch
//! anything, so it meets every live access in its domain and it makes every
//! later access meet it.
//!
//! That is the honest cost of rung three, and it is measured
//! ([`Census::domain_only_comparisons`]) rather than hidden, because the point
//! of measuring it is to know what narrowing an access would buy.
