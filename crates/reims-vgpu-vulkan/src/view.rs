//! The views one image is addressed through: the whole texture a shader
//! samples, and the one exact slice a render pass attaches.
//!
//! # Why the attachment views are expanded eagerly
//!
//! A render pass attaches *one* mip level of *one* layer. Vulkan has no way to
//! say that in the attachment itself — the selection is the view, so a texture
//! with seven levels and twelve layers needs eighty-four distinct
//! `VkImageView`s to be fully attachable, and which one a pass wants is not
//! known until the pass arrives.
//!
//! Creating them on demand is the shape that looks cheaper. It is not: the
//! demand arrives inside pass setup, so a creation failure there loses a frame
//! that was already recorded against, and a cache keyed by (level, layer) is
//! one more thing whose entries have to outlive submissions naming them. The
//! set is finite, known at allocation, and small — [`Texture::subresources`]
//! is levels times layers — so it is built once with the image and its
//! lifetime is the image's.
//!
//! [`attachments`] is what produces that set, in a fixed order, so a pass can
//! index it rather than search it.
//!
//! # A volume's slices are not its layers
//!
//! Rendering to one depth slice of a 3D texture is an attachment of a 2D view
//! over that slice — the layer count is one and the depth is what varies. So
//! the expansion iterates *slices*, which are the layers for every other type
//! and the level's depth for a volume. Iterating `layers()` for a volume would
//! produce exactly one attachment for a texture that has one per slice per
//! level, and the missing ones would be discovered as a pass that cannot be
//! set up.
//!
//! That view also needs a create flag the image does not otherwise carry, so
//! [`crate::image::plan`] sets it for a volume declared as a render target.
//! It is a property of the image and cannot be added later.
//!
//! # A sampled view names one plane; an attachment names what the format is
//!
//! A descriptor's image view may name at most one of `DEPTH` and `STENCIL`
//! (VUID-VkDescriptorImageInfo-imageView-01976), while an attachment over a
//! combined format names both. So the two views this module produces do not
//! share an aspect rule, and [`aspect`] — which answers what a format is made
//! of — is the attachment's answer and the transfer paths', not the sampled
//! one's.
//!
//! Which plane a sampled binding wants is not a guess: the guest says it in
//! the *view's* pixel format rather than the texture's, and
//! `MTLPixelFormatX32_Stencil8` / `X24_Stencil8` exist for no other purpose.
//! Both translate to the same `VkFormat` as the combined spelling they view,
//! so the plane survives only in the guest ordinal, which is why [`whole`]
//! takes it.
//!
//! # No Vulkan call
//!
//! Every function here produces a create info and none of them creates
//! anything, so the whole expansion — the counts, the order, the aspect masks
//! and the ranges — is tested with no GPU.
