//! `MTLPixelFormat` → `VkFormat`, including the sRGB transfer function and the
//! component mapping Vulkan needs where its channel set differs from Metal's.
//!
//! # Why this table is total
//!
//! Before it, the same Metal→Vulkan pixel decision was re-made at each call
//! site that needed one, and the sRGB qualifier was folded into its linear
//! sibling at twelve independent sites with no record that anything was lost.
//! A lost qualifier looked exactly like a supported format. Here every
//! contract-defined `MTL_FORMAT_*` value has exactly one arm, `*_SRGB` formats
//! reach their `VK_FORMAT_*_SRGB` counterpart, and anything else declines by
//! name through [`Refusal::UnknownPixelFormat`].
//!
//! # sRGB is a choice, not an accident
//!
//! A path that genuinely cannot apply the transfer function (because it is
//! moving raw texels, not shading) asks for [`PixelFormat::linear_vk`], and the
//! doors that hand a linear sibling back say so in their own answer — see
//! [`Sampled::srgb_lost`]. The loss is then one grep away instead of invisible.
//!
//! # What this module is not allowed to know
//!
//! It maps one vocabulary onto another and holds no state, no handle and no
//! host capability. Whether *this* device can sample, render to or store a
//! format it names is a capability question the rail answers elsewhere; whether
//! a role admits the format at all is a contract question
//! `pixel_format::render_target_bpp` / `storage_selector` / `sampled_class`
//! already answer. Folding either into this table would make one guest format
//! mean two things depending on where it was asked.

///   must be class-compatible with the format the SPIR-V module declares, and
///   the SPIR-V image-format operand has no sRGB member at all
///   (`runtime::spirv_bind::ImageFormat`). Vulkan likewise does not apply the
///   transfer function on an image store.
/// * **Its consumer reasons about the enum by name.** The compute path picks a
///   view format by comparing the guest surface's format class against the
///   shader's declared one; expressed over `VkFormat` that reasoning would have
///   to be spelled in `runtime/`, which is exactly the boundary

    /// is its own member sharing `R8_UNORM` with
    /// [`StorageImageFormat::R8Unorm`], and [`storage_image_components`] is the
    /// plan the sampled view binds.
    ///
    /// - The two `*_SRGB` orders would have to bind their linear sibling, which
    ///   is the [`TranslateReason::SrgbDowngraded`] loss
    ///   [`sampled_pixels`] hands its caller. This rail's `Result` has nowhere
    ///   to record it, and
    ///   [`storage_image`] refuses sRGB for the same reason with its own test
    ///   pinning that. Admitting it silently here would break the symmetry the
    ///   crate relies on, so it waits for the rail to gain a warning channel.
    ///
    /// - The **BC block-compressed families** cannot cross this rail at all,
    ///   and that is structural rather than pending a channel. A
    ///   [`StorageImageFormat`] is what a compute *storage* binding is created
    ///   as, and Vulkan has no block-compressed storage-image format — a shader
    ///   cannot write a block. The compute rail routes its sampled textures
    ///   through that same selector, so a compressed texture sampled inside a
    ///   dispatch is refused by name. Giving it a rail of its own means a
    ///   compute sampled path that does not go through the storage selector,
    ///   which is a change to that rail and not to this table.
    ///
    ///   Measured on the workload that brought the family in: Asphalt 8 samples
    ///   its BC3 textures from **fragment** shaders only, so this refusal cost
    ///   nothing there. A guest that samples one in a dispatch loses that
    ///   dispatch's texture and says so.
    ///
    /// The converse is deliberately not asserted: this rail carries the integer
    /// and packed formats a compute shader reads and [`sampled_pixels`] has no
