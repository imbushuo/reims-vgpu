//! The `VkDevice` and everything that dies with it.
//!
//! # What an epoch is, and why it is a boundary rather than a field
//!
//! A `VkDevice` can be lost, and when it is, every handle made from it becomes
//! unusable at the same instant: queues, timeline semaphores, command pools,
//! descriptor pools, allocations, pipelines. The architecture makes that set an
//! object — the device epoch — precisely so no code has to remember which
//! handles those were. There is one active epoch per live session, and an old
//! one is retained only until the host work it already issued is retired or
//! abandoned.
//!
//! Guest semantic validity and Vulkan handle validity are different lifetimes,
//! and a native lease carries both: a session generation says whether the guest
//! still means the object, and [`EpochId`] says whether its handles may still
//! be touched. Collapsing them makes a guest reset destroy live GPU work, or a
//! device loss leave semantic state claiming to own dead handles.
//!
//! That identity is [`reims_vgpu_core::identity::DeviceEpoch`] and is *given*
//! to [`DeviceEpoch::create`] rather than minted here. The session owns which
//! incarnation this is — it is the value [`reims_vgpu_core::retire`] compares a
//! queued destruction against — and a rail that numbered its own would be a
//! second answer to the one question a stale lease asks.
//!
//! # The enabled set is derived from the census and from nothing else
//!
//! [`Enabled::for_census`] is the one place a feature or extension is asked
//! for, and it can only ask for what [`Census::take`] already admitted. That is
//! the difference between a rail that uses a capability and one that hopes for
//! it: enabling a feature the device did not report is undefined behaviour that
//! usually works, right up to the driver where it does not.
//!
//! The floor is enabled unconditionally because a device that could not supply
//! it never became a census in the first place.
//!
//! # This module creates the device and stops
//!
//! It owns no command pool, no descriptor pool, no allocation and no pipeline.
//! Those are per-worker or per-owner and are handed the device rather than
//! living in it — see [`crate::pools`] and [`crate::descriptor`]. What is here
//! is what device creation itself decides: which features are on, which
//! extensions are requested, and which queues exist.
