//! `MTLStorageMode`, and what this wire's use of it does and does not license.
//!
//! # The three guest-backed storage modes
//!
//! The mode arrives as `resource_options[7:4]` — the ordinal shifted left by
//! four, which is `MTLResourceOptions`' documented storage-mode shift rather
//! than a bare mode field. Three ordinals are pinned by fixtures that moved the
//! nibble alone: shared, managed, private. Memoryless is a separate object-list
//! contract, now recovered in [`crate::memoryless`]: type 9 carries only a
//! serializer creation command and no guest allocation. This guest-backed
//! placement vocabulary still refuses it rather than assigning guest pages to
//! a pass-local attachment.
//!
//! # Private is an announcement, not an access contract
//!
//! This is the reading that is easy to get backwards and expensive to get
//! wrong, so it is stated where the type is rather than at a call site.
//!
//! `Private` looks like a licence to stop keeping guest pages current for a
//! resource the guest has declared GPU-only. It is not one on this wire, and
//! the emitting serializer says why: backing is allocated mode-blind, so a
//! private texture still gets page-rounded guest backing exactly as a shared one
//! does; the guest still CPU-touches it, because create-with-contents,
//! region-replace and get-bytes each copy through that mapping with no
//! storage-mode check on the path; and what the mode actually gates is the
//! *announcement* — the modified-range notification is emitted only for
//! `Managed`.
//!
//! So private means "I will not tell you when I write this", not "I will not
//! write this". Treating it as the latter turns silence into a guarantee of
//! inaction, and the resulting stale-page defect is invisible at every counter
//! because its only symptom is wrong content.
//!
//! [`StorageMode::announces_writes`] is therefore the question this vocabulary
//! answers, and there is deliberately no `skips_guest_coherence`. What is not
//! established is the *receiving* side: absence of a mode-dependent branch has
//! been read on the emitting serializer only, so a future host deserializer
//! reading is what would reopen this.
